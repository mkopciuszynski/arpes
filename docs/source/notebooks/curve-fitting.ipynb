    "# Curve Fitting in PyARPES\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why curve fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Curve fitting is an extremely important technique in angle resolved-photoemission because it provides a coherent way of dealing with noisy data, it allows for simple treatment of backgrounds, it avoids painful questions of interpretation inherent with some techniques, and it grants access to the rich information ARPES provides of the single particle spectral function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple curve fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "PyARPES uses `lmfit` in order to provide a user friendly, compositional API for curve fitting. This allows users to define more complicated models using operators like `+` and `*`, but also makes the process of curve fitting transparent and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will prepare an EDC with a step edge, and fit it with a linear density of states multiplied by the Fermi distribution and convolved with Gaussian instrumental broadening (`AffineBroadenedFD`). In general in PyARPES, we use extensions of the models available in `lmfit`, which provides an xarray compatible and unitful fitting function `guess_fit`. This has more or less the same call signature as `fit except that we do not need to pass the X and Y data separately, the X data is provided by the dataset coordinates."
