    "# Curve Fitting in PyARPES\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why curve fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Curve fitting is an extremely important technique in angle resolved-photoemission because it provides a coherent way of dealing with noisy data, it allows for simple treatment of backgrounds, it avoids painful questions of interpretation inherent with some techniques, and it grants access to the rich information ARPES provides of the single particle spectral function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple curve fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "PyARPES uses `lmfit` in order to provide a user friendly, compositional API for curve fitting. This allows users to define more complicated models using operators like `+` and `*`, but also makes the process of curve fitting transparent and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will prepare an EDC with a step edge, and fit it with a linear density of states multiplied by the Fermi distribution and convolved with Gaussian instrumental broadening (`AffineBroadenedFD`). From Ver. 5.0 of PyARPES, we use xarray-lmfit package, which provides an xarray compatible and unitful fitting function. By this change, the coordinate must be specified explicitly.  While one may feel that it many be not elegant, we believe that it follows Zen of python \"Explicit is better than implicit\". And reagardless the dimension of the data, we can take the same procedure for fitting. And if you experienced lmfit, the operation process quite easy to understand. Use S.modelfit instead of fit function as follows."
