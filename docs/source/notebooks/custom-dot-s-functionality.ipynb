    "# Data Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data primitive in PyARPES is the `xarray.DataArray`. However, adding additional scientific functionality is needed since `xarray` provides only very general functionality. The approach that we take is described in some detail in the `xarray` documentation at [extending xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/internals.html#extending-xarray), which allows putting additional functionality on all arrays and datasets on particular, registered attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyARPES we use a few of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `.S` attribute: functionality associated with spectra (physics here)\n",
    "2. `.G` attribute: general abstract functionality that could reasonably be a part of xarray core\n",
    "3. `.F` attribute: functionality associated with curve fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveat: In general these accessors can and do behave slightly differently between datasets and arrays, depending on what makes contextual sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will describe just some of the functionality provided by the `.S` attribute, while the following section will describe some of the functionality on `.G` and the section on curve fitting describes much of what is available through `.F`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much more can be learned about them by viewing the definitions in `arpes.xarray_extensions`."

    "As an alternative to interpolating, you can integrate in a small rectangular or ellipsoidal region around a point using `.S.select_around`. You can also do this for a sequence of points using `.S.select_around_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions can be run in either summing or averaging mode using either `mode='sum'` or `mode='mean'` respectively. Using the radius parameter you can specify the integration radius in pixels (`int`) or in unitful (`float`) values for all (pass a single value) or for specific (`dict`) axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`select_around_data` operates in the same way, except that instead of passing a single point, `select_around_data` expects a dictionary or Dataset mapping axis names to iterable collections of coordinates.\n",
