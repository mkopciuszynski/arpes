Installation
============

Some common issues in installation have been written up in the
:doc:`FAQ <faq>`.

You can install PyARPES in an editable configuration so that you can
edit it to your needs (recommended) or as a standalone package from a
package manager. In the latter case, you should put any custom code in a
separate module which you import together with PyARPES to serve your
particular analysis needs.

Installation from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using an installation from source is the best option if you want to
frequently change the source of PyARPES as you work. You can use code
available either from the main repository at
`GitHub <https://github.com/arafune/arpes>`.

1. Install `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/>`__
2. Clone or otherwise download the repository

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/arafune/arpes

3. Make a python environment according to our provided specification, and activate

.. code:: bash

   cd path/to/pyarpes
   uv venv  (if path/to/pyarpes/.venv does not exist.)
   source .venv/bin/activate  (Activation way depends on your shell.)
   uv sync

4. *Recommended:* Configure IPython kernel according to the **Barebones
   Kernel Installation** below. Especially, to use pyarpes on JupyterLab,

.. code:: bash

   python -m ipykernel install --user --display-name "My Name Here"

Additional Suggested Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install and configure standard tools like
   `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__ or `Jupyter Lab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__. 
2. Explore the documentation and example notebooks at 
   `the documentation site <https://arpes-v4.readthedocs.io/en/daredevil/>`__.

Barebones kernel installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have Jupyter and just need to register your environment.
You can do

.. code:: bash

   pip install ipykernel
   python -m ipykernel install --user 

You can also give the kernel a different display name in Juptyer with
``python -m ipykernel install --user --display-name "My Name Here"``.
