    The reduced axis corresponds to individual observations of a tensor/array valued quantity.
    This axis can be passed or inferred from a set of standard observation-like axes.

    New data variables are created with names `{name}` and `{name}_std`.
    If a name is not attached to the DataArray, it should be provided.

    Args:
        data: The input data (Both DataArray and Dataset).
        axis: The name of the dimension which we should perform the reduction along.
        name: The name of the variable which should be reduced. By default, uses `data.name`.

        relevant variable in the input DataArray.  (Dimension is reduced.)
