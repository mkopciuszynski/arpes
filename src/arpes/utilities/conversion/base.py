    """Infrastructure code to support a new coordinate conversion routine.

    In order to do coordinate conversion from c_i to d_i, we need to give functions
    c_i(d_j), i.e. to implement the inverse transform. This is so that we convert by
    interpolating the function from a regular grid of d_i values back to the original
    data expressed in c_i.

    From this, we can see what responsibilities these conversion classes hold:

    * They need to specify how to calculate c_i(d_j)
    * They need to cache computations so that computations of c_i(d_j) can be performed
      efficiently for different coordinates c_i
    * Because they know how to do the inverse conversion, they need to know how to choose
      reasonable grid bounds for the forward transform, so that this can be handled
      automatically.

    These different roles and how they are accomplished are discussed in detail below.

        The CoordinateConverter.prep method allows you to pre-compute some transformations

        This is useful if you want the conversion methods to have separation of concern,
        but if it is advantageous for them to be able to share a computation of some
        variable. An example of this is in BE-kx-ky conversion, where computing k_p_tot
        is a step in both converting kx and ky, so we would like to avoid doing it twice.

        Of course, you can neglect this function entirely. Another technique is to simple
        cache computations as they arrive. This is the technique that is used in
